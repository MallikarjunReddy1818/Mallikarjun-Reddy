    "A Conda environment was set up with Python 3.10.14 and PyCaret installed to work with churn data. The data was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and prepared for analysis, with 'Churn' as the target variable. The data was split into training and testing sets, and missing values were handled. After testing several algorithms, Logistic Regression was found to be the best, achieving an accuracy of 79.20% and an AUC score of 0.8361. The model was saved using both PyCaret and Python’s pickle module. It was then used to predict whether a specific customer was likely to churn, showcasing how effective PyCaret is for automating churn prediction.\n"
